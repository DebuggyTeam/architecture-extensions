## About Architecture Extensions
The mod idea for Architecture Extensions is technically based off the old ![ArchitectureCraft mod from MC 1.8-1.10](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/architecturecraft). The major differences are that the added blocks are not "super detailed" like in the original AC mod and there are blocks that are not in the original mod either.
