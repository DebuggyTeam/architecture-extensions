## About Architecture Extensions
The mod idea for Architecture Extensions is technically based off the old ![ArchitectureCraft mod from MC 1.8-1.10](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/architecturecraft). The major differences are that the added blocks are not "super detailed" like in the original AC mod and there are blocks that are not in the original mod either.

## About Ports
The Debuggy Team won't be porting any of our mods to Forge, Fabric, or any previous Minecraft version.

If you want a Debuggy mod on, say, Forge 1.12.2 or on 1.7.10, you are welcome to create a port yourself, as long as you follow the project's license. Please let us know if you do, as we may endorse high-quality ports!
